0x610: MSR_PKG_POWER_LIMIT = 0x384b00011483e8
0x606: MSR_RAPL_POWER_UNIT = 00000000000a0e03

1/2^TIME_UNIT
time unit = 10 because that bit in the RAPL_POWER_UNIT is a which is 10.
1/1024 seconds


Power Limit #1 is bits 0-14 of PKG_POWER_LIMIT
83e8 is bits 0-15
the 8 = 1000 in binary
1  0   0  0
15 14 13 12


just use 00 not the 10.

so the hex value becomes 03e8
which is 1000 eigths of a watt.
power limit = 125 watts (1000/8)


TIME Limit field:
0x384b00011483e8

bitmask to find the 17-23:
0x7F

in c: (data is the register value)
mask = 0x7F << 17;
value = data&mask;
value = value >> 17;


START ASSIGNMENT INFO
			Assignment for next Friday at 8pm
			- 50 runs of FIRESTARTER @ 50 different power bounds (mostly useful & limit firestarter runs to 10 seconds each with all cores)
			- Measure end to end iterations (reported by FIRESTARTER option)
			Average Power (end to end)
			Total Instructions Retired
			Total Actual cycles (APERF)

			4 graphs 
			Power limit on x axis
			observed on the Y axis

			Finally, (All sampled at 10 ms)
			Instructions Retired
			Cycles w/ 2, 3, 4 instructions retired
			Instructions per cycle
			(Record reference cycles)
			Graph:
			x axis Actual Time
			y Axis observed


			7 Graphs Total..


			END ASSIGNMENT INFO


20 different power bounds
End to end instructions retired
zero out accumulator when it begins
firestarter in between for ten seconds
read when it ends
