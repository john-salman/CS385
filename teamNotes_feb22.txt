To do:
Look at delta power_energy_status (0x611)
  - register increments to show total energy consumption since last
    clearing of registers.
  - bits 0-31
  
Look at MSR_PP0_POWER_LIMIT (0x610)
  -bits 0-14 (power limit actual)
       + showing 800 for us
  - read the og with firestarter
  - modify dem bits yo
  - run again with the firestarter
  
  Results:
    OG: 800->57314557
    New1: 500->60881428
    New2: 80->20780329
